# Single Shot MultiBox Detector
### credits
original paper : [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325)

### Plan
We have lot of detection pipelines available to us. I am interested in only two of these. 
First, Single Shot Multibox Detector, Which when revealed claimed state-of-results with near lighting processing 
speed of 40 fps. 
Second, YOLO9000, Which took the best parts of SSD and Faster-RCNN and improved its first version.

I am going to implement both the papers in tensorflow and try to build a face detection system.
